# My Claude Code Plugin Marketplace

This is my personal marketplace of Claude Code plugins.

## Available Plugins

### [Git Rewriter](plugins/git-rewriter/)

Rewrite git commit sequences to create clean, readable branches optimized for code review.

**Version:** 0.1.1

Takes messy commit history (WIP commits, fixes, typos) and rewrites it into logical, well-documented commits that tell a clear story.
