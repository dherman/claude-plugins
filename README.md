# My Claude Code Plugin Marketplace

This is my personal marketplace of Claude Code plugins.

## Available Plugins

### [Historian](plugins/historian/)

Rewrite git commit sequences to create clean, readable branches optimized for code review.

Takes messy commit history (WIP commits, fixes, typos) and rewrites it into logical, well-documented commits that tell a clear story.
